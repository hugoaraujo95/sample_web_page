          <p>Written by Dan Barret and Tim Macuga, this 2008 record is considered a cult album.
          It was released on January 1, 2008 on Enemies List Home Recordings. The album is a double album;
          the first disc is entitled "The Plow That Broke the Plains",
          the second one entitled "The Future". The album was reissued in 2009 by Enemies List,
          re-pressing the album on vinyl and CD, with new cover art.
          The reissue included a 70-page booklet with various paintings and lyrics.
          The album has gained a substantial cult following in recent years as a result of its bleak
          subject matter and lo-fi production. Another reissue of the double-album was released
          September 17, 2014 by Enemies List and The Flenser.</p>
